            <p style="font-family:verdana"> The first phase of Pinnacle One Yonge pictured on April 23, 2021. As harsher Covid-19 restrictions took effect over the week in the Greater Toronto Area. Construction was able to continue. Approximately 46 stories up, Pinnacle has constructed over half of the smaller tower, already making a significant mark on the skyline. Excavation has almost finished for the 312 metre supertall to be constructed within the second of the three phases. All three are set to be completed by early 2024, narrowly missing out on the titles of Toronto's (and Canada) first supertall and tallest building. </p>

      <h5 style="font-family:verdana">The One continues to rise above it's complicated and intricate podium situated at the corner of Bloor and Yonge.</h5>
     <img src="http://theone-bloorwestcondos.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/a1.jpg" style="height:500px;">
      <p style="font-family:verdana">"The One Condos will be the tallest residential tower in Canada at 338 metres featuring a stunning atrium that simply wows anyone who first steps inside the doors. From there, the first eight floors of The One Condos will have extra high ceilings to accommodate a plethora of retail space. These retail partners will be hand-picked to allow residents of The One Condos incredibly convenient perks just seconds from their doorsteps! Furthermore, residents will have total customization of their suite’s floor plan allowing them to have their home exactly how they envision it. The One Condos is expected to have approximately 416 suites 650 and 9000 sqft."</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:verdana">Lower Don Lands Redevelopment</h2>
      <h5 style="font-family:verdana">A new greenspace is taking shape in a once concrete dominated area</h5>
      <img src="https://cdn.skyrisecities.com/sites/default/files/images/projects/2937/2937-7267.jpg" style="height:500px;">     
      <p style="font-family:verdana">The Lower Don Lands Redevelopment signals a new commitment to sustainable development and communities. This new hub centered around Cherry Street and Villiers Street in the old portlands is in the process of being completely transformed to a green and flourishing parkland community comparable to a nature centric Millenium Park. Construction on these 308 acres began in late 2019 to early 2020, following designs dating back to 2007. When completed, the green community would include canals and parkland with such a stature that would rival the likes of High Park and Trinity Bellwoods-Christie Pits. It's close proximity to the future east harbour transit hub makes it all the more appealing. </p>

      <h2 style="font-family:verdana">The growth of cycling infrastructure in Toronto </h2>
      <h5 style="font-family:verdana">"With new bike lanes being implemented on Dundas Street West, Gladstone Avenue, Brant Street and Cummer Avenue, the city continues to expand the cycling network in a time of a "bikers boom"</h5>
     <img src="https://media.blogto.com/articles/20200812-bike-lanes-toronto-1.jpg?w=2048&cmd=resize_then_crop&height=1365&quality=70" style="height:500px;">
      <p style="font-family:verdana">"Bikes are sold out all over Toronto from kids' 3 speeds all the way to high end DeRosas. In these last 10 years the City of Toronto has starting implementing bike lanes in most possible places in order to encourage sustainable and eco-friendly transportations. Creating these bike lanes in high demand areas helps supplement for the lack of sufficient public transit in the GTA. These routes continue to be built on both streets major and minor in the time of the pandemic where people are starting to regain their footing on bikes once again. The benefits for both the environment and the biker are endless. When it comes to Bloor Street business owners ... it's another story.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:verdana">How an unlikely intersection was transformed into one of the tallest corners in the world. </h2>
      <h5 style="font-family:verdana">"What's next for Yonge and Gerrard?"</h5>
     <img src="theunlikelyintersection.jpeg" style="height:500px;">
      <p style="font-family:verdana">"Yonge and Gerrard just some fourteen years ago was an entire different world. An empty parking lot on one side and a small liquidations company on the other. Nothing over 3 stories, all low density. Fourteen years later stands Aura at the northwest corner towering above the rest of the area with three other mammoth proposals waiting in the wings. The 250 metre mark has long been a rarity in the City of Toronto, but there will soon be 5 buildings exceeding this mark at one intersection alone, by far the tallest intersection in Canada, and one of the tallest in the world. "</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2 style="font-family:verdana">"Can we get much higher?" </h2>
      <h5 style="font-family:verdana">"In wake of recent mega-proposals, Torontonians and developers alike start to wonder about what our limits actually are."</h5>
     <img src="https://cdn.skyrisecities.com/sites/default/files/images/projects/42381/42381-123705.jpg" style="height:500px;">
      <p style="font-family:verdana">With dreamy and lofty new proposals such as 1200 Bay Street and 212 King Street West well exceeding supertall status of 300 metres, the preconcieved notions that Toronto city planners shy away from extravagantly designed and tall buldings have been proven wrong. Surpassing Chicago within 2021 in  amount of skyscrapers, Toronto is now only second to New York. Closing the quantity gap will be far in the future, but closing the quality gap that has long existed between Toronto and New York seems to be in the mere moments of occuring. </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2 style="font-family:verdana">"The future of sustainable High Speed Rail: Toronto to Quebec City" </h2>
      <h5 style="font-family:verdana">How realistic is this game changer?</h5>
     <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Georgetown_GO_Train_Eastbound.jpg/1200px-Georgetown_GO_Train_Eastbound.jpg" style="height:500px;">
      <p style="font-family:verdana">"Since 1998, the ideaa of high speed rail between Quebec has long been a dream, but slowly we are inching towards a reality. As the City Of Toronto has been in dire need of sustainable and eco-friendly transit and the Quebec-St.Lawrence Corridor isn't well connected to southern Ontario, politicians are starting to once again consider a high speed rail line connecting Toronto, Kingston, Montréal and Quebec City. Although high speed rail is a rarity in North America, It has been proven successful in countries like China, Italy and France."</p>
